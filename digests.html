    Ulcerative Colitis Symptoms May Be Treated with Probiotics

  <p>
    Ulcerative colitis is a disorder is marked by chronic inflammation and the formation of ulcers in the innermost layer of the intestines. It can prove painful and frustrating to live with, especially when ordinary treatments fail to provide relief.
  </p>
  <p>
    While there is no known cure for the disorder, studies show that probiotics and other new therapies aid in decreasing inflammation in the gut. How are these therapies different from conventional approaches that do not seem to work for most people? These therapies target the gut microbiome, which is naturally diverse and incredibly beneficial in maintaining natural body processes like digestion and immunity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ulcerative colitis disrupts the balance of microorganisms living in the gut which leads to discomfort, chronic inflammation and poor immune function. By restoring a natural balance to the gut microbiota, the body can better regulate these primal systems and reduce the pain and inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis.

    Gestational Diabetes Can Be Prevented with Probiotics
    <br>

      Extracted from <i>Dietary interventions, lifestyle changes, and dietary supplements in preventing gestational diabetes mellitus: a literature review</i>, available at PubMed.gov

  </div>
  <p>
    Due to recent research, probiotics and other dietary modifications have deserved a closer look into the mechanism with which they prevent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
</p>
<p>
    Current treatment for GDM includes diet with or without medications. These treatments are expensive and often harmful to natural body systems. If left untreated, however, GDM can hurt your baby.
</p>
<p>
    It is essential for mothers who have had diabetes or are at risk for acquiring GDM to take extra care of their health during pregnancy. Is this you or a loved one?
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, recent studies are suggesting that a combination of probiotic supplementation and new lifestyle changes can be effective in preventing GDM. </p>

    Probiotics Reduce Bowel Symptoms in Colon Cancer Survivors
    <br>
    <div class="byLine">
      Extracted from <i>Effects of 12 weeks of probiotic supplementation on quality of life in colorectal cancer survivors: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial</i>, available at PubMed.gov

  <p>
    Researchers found that survivors of colon cancer benefit from probiotic supplementation. Colon cancer has become increasingly treatable. Due to the fortunate rise in survivorship, researchers have shifted their focus onto the reduction of bowel symptoms in cancer survivors post-treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
     Chemotherapy, radiation and other colon cancer therapies can leave the gut feeling scathed and irritable, sometimes causing discomfort for years after treatment. Irritable bowel symptoms that persist after treatment have a negative impact on the quality of life for survivors.
  </p>
  <p>
     A study by the Department of Family Medicine at Yonsei University in Korea found that probiotics can improve the quality of life for colon cancer survivors. After the 12 week trial, those who were administered probiotics experienced a reduction in irritable bowel symptoms.
   </p>
   <p>
     This exciting research shows the promise that probiotics have in improving the lives of colorectal cancer survivors.

    Colic Symptoms Can Be Treated With Probiotics

    Colicky babies can make parenting a challenge. Colic is identified as pain and discomfort in the abdomen due to intestinal gas or obstructions, and it is most commonly found in babies. Colic is diagnosed in babies based on three general rules of crying.

    Probiotics Reduce the Prevalence of the Common Cold/Flu During Times of Stress
    <br>
    <div class="byLine">
      Extracted from <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum R0071 results in a greater proportion of healthy days and a lower percentage of academically stressed students reporting a day of cold/flu: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study</i>, available at PubMed.gov

    </div>
  <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5050/5242760927_cc8f6ca24d_b.jpg" style="width:500px;">
  </div>
  <p>
    Acute psychological stress is positively associated with the common cold/flu. When the body is stressed, the immune system can become overwhelmed.
  </p><p>
    Fortunately, recent studies have shown that probiotics can help reduce the impact of the common cold/flu on people experiencing acute episodes of high stress. The Food Science and Human Nutrition Department of the University of Florida conducted a study to determine the efficacy of probiotics in preventing days of cold/flu symptoms in academically stressed students. The percentage of students who reported cold/flu symptoms during the 6 week trial period was significantly lower in those who were given particular probiotic strains.
</p><p>
    Probiotics have been associated with improved immune system functions, which may be the mechanism behind preventing the common cold/flu during times of acute stress. If you are someone who experiences frequent stress episodes, probiotics may be key in helping you maintain your healthy immune system!

    Probiotics as Treatment for H. Pylori
    <br>
    <div class="byLine">
      Extracted from <i>Probiotics for standard triple Helicobacter pylori eradication: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial</i>, available at PubMed.gov
      <br><br>
    </div>
  <img src="http://maxpixel.freegreatpicture.com/static/photo/1x/Imitation-Bacteria-Aureus-Bacterial-Species-106583.jpg" style="width:500px;">
  </div>
  <p>
    H. Pylori is a type of bacteria that invades and attacks the lining of the stomach. The lining of the stomach helps protect you from the acid that digests your food. If H. Pylori does enough damage, acid can penetrate through the lining and cause ulcers to form. These ulcers are responsible for infections, bleeding and severe pain in those who acquire them.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are currently three effective therapies that eliminate the H. Pylori bacteria from the digestive tract. However, a study done by the Department of Gastroenterology at the Clinical Hospital Centre in Rijeka, Croatia, found that probiotics are highly effective in the treatment of H. Pylori infections when added to these therapies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Probiotics reduced adverse symptoms and effects of treatments. The study found that the presence and intensity of stomach pain, bloating, flatulence, taste disturbance, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, rash, and diarrhea were significantly lower in people who were given probiotics. This is promising in developing further treatments for those who suffer from H. Pylori infections.
